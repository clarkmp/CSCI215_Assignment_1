	<h1> Who is Daft Punk? </h1>

		<div id="col1">
		<h2>History of Daft Punk </h2>
		<p>Daft Punk is a French electronic music duo formed in 1993 by Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter. The duo achieved significant popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement and had continuous success in the years following, combining elements of house music with funk, techno, disco, rock music and synthpop influences. They are also known for their visual stylization and disguises associated with their music; the duo have worn ornate helmets and gloves to assume robot personas in most of their public appearances since 2001 and rarely grant interviews or appear on television. The duo were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (also known as Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records.</p>

		<h2> Their Rise to Fame </h2>
		<p>Bangalter and de Homem-Christo were originally in an indie rock band named Darlin' which disbanded after a short period of time, leaving the two to experiment musically with drum machines and synthesizers. The duo released their debut studio album Homework through Virgin Records in 1997 to highly positive reviews. The duo's next album Discovery (2001) was even more successful, driven by the release of the hit singles "One More Time", "Digital Love" and "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger". In March 2005, the duo released their third album Human After All to mixed reviews. However, the singles "Robot Rock" and "Technologic" achieved considerable success in the United Kingdom.</p>
