		<h3>Homework (1997) </h3> 
		<p>
		Homework is the debut studio album by the French electronic music duo Daft Punk, released on 20 January 1997 by Virgin Records and Soma Quality Recordings. The album revived house music and departed from the Eurodance formula. The duo produced the tracks without plans to release an album. After working on projects that were intended to be separate singles over five months, they considered the material good enough for an album.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Discovery (2001) </h3>
		<p>
		Discovery is the second studio album by French electronic music duo Daft Punk, released on 26 February 2001 by Virgin Records. It marks a shift from the Chicago house sound prevalent on their first studio record, Homework (1997), to a house style more heavily inspired by disco, post-disco, garage house, and synthpop. Comparing their stylistic approach to their previous album, band member Thomas Bangalter described Discovery as an exploration of song structures and musical forms whereas Homework was "raw" electronic music. He also described Discovery as a reflection of the duo's childhood memories, when they would listen to music with a more playful and innocent viewpoint.

		<h3>Human After All (2005) </h3>
		<p>
		Human After All is the third studio album by the French electronic music duo Daft Punk, released on 14 March 2005 internationally and a day later in the United States by Virgin Records. With this album, the duo took a more minimalistic and improvisational approach to their music using a mixture of guitars and electronics.[3][4] A remix album, Human After All: Remixes was released exclusively in Japan. Human After All was Daft Punk's last studio album to be released by Virgin Records.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Random Access Memories (2013) </h3>
		<p>
		Random Access Memories is the fourth studio album by French electronic music duo Daft Punk, released on 17 May 2013 by the duo's imprint Daft Life and Columbia Records. The album pays tribute to the late 1970s and early 1980s American music, particularly from Los Angeles. This theme is reflected in the album's packaging, as well as its promotional campaign, which included billboards, television advertisements and a web series.
